# Isopropyl Alcohol Cleaning Alternatives

- In-Stock Alert Sites: Not exactly an alternative, but a good strategy to get some iso. One example is nowinstock.net, but make sure to sign up for text alerts as these go fast. Another: brickseek.com is great for checking walmart/target/cvs inventory

- Drinking Alcohols: The higher the proof the better. The two most popular choices are to use Everclear (or any other high proof grain alcohol) and Bacardi 151 rum, both upwards of 70% alcohol by volume. They are both common liquors that you should be able to find in liquor stores, although some states and countries have restrictions on Everclear. Added bonus: reuse the alcohol that you use, it will work many times. Eventually you will have a very potent mixture than can be evaporated down to a tincture or all the way to just reclaim.

- Warm Water and Soap: Not really much to talk about here, the hotter the water the better. As with all cleanings, make sure to rinse off any residue from the soap and let dry.

- Milk/Fats: Making stem milk, or something similar, works well for cleaning glass stems, dynavap parts, and other smaller sized pieces. Essentially you want to get some milk, let it simmer (do not boil it), put your parts in, and keep going until they’re as clean as you want them. Depending on how dirty your materials are and how hot the milk is, your cooking time will vary. You’ll need to rinse off your pieces afterwards, but with some hot water they should be nice and clean. You’ll have drinkable reclaim as well, either straight up or mixed into coffee, tea, etc.

- PBW - Powdered Brewer’s Wash: Put some powder in your glass and add in hot water. There is a thread on FC with a ton of info.

- Warm water and vinegar: Similar to warm water and soap, get scrubbing!

- Acetone: Acetone is very powerful, use with caution. Recommended for glass only, can damage plastic. Even with glass, be careful with logos or etchings.

- d-Limonene Not necessarily but you just wouldn’t want to expose it to certain materials. On stainless steel, quartz, or glass it wouldn’t be corrosive but sillicone, rubber, nylon, and generally any plastics you would want to stick with alcohol. I would keep it far away from any electrical components/wiring but I would expect that is a given.

 If you’re cleaning a glass water pipe that’s dirty with resin/tars you could just 
 dump some straight in, swirl it around, add some hot water and shake it up more. 
 Rinse thoroughly after with warm water but leave it empty to air dry. If you are 
 cleaning small internal components for your device you’d likely be better off just 
 pouring a small amount into a cup then dipping a qtip in it to scrub off the 
 resins.

 Again just let everything air dry thoroughly in a ventilated area before resuming 
 use as you would with alcohols. Terpenes are also highly combustible so treat them 
 with caution as you would any chemical solvent— wear gloves, wash it off, don’t 
 let it get near your eyes, etc.

 Limonene also works extremely well to remove the adhesives/glues that form that 
 sticky goo when you peel a label or price tag off of something. It is actually the 
 main constituent in the products that are marketed to do exactly this.

- Simple Green Crystal eco-friendly, powerful, cheap. Seems to be pretty good stuff!

General cleaning tips to make the most of what you’ve got:

- Have a bowl with your device before you clean it, it will be much easier to clean the yuck when it’s hot as well as being more enjoyable when you’re high.

- Use salt when cleaning glass pieces with alcohol or other similar methods, the salt works as an abrasive to help the alcohol clean your piece.

- Just a q-tip dipped in iso can help with routine maintenance, making the deep cleans easier

- get an ultrasonic cleaner to make cleaning things that much easier
